# Name Project

Slides for what?.

Originally conceived for the [2024 February talk GDG Bologna](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-bologna-presents-guida-essenziale-allintegrazione-di-angular-e-signal-un-approccio-pratico/) (in Italian), Bologna, 2024-02-27.

Built on top of [P-Slides](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/p-slides)!

## Building

Node.js 10.x is required (actually it could work in Node 8 - haven't checked).

To start the presentation in development mode:

1. Clone the repository;
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`

Or `npm run build` to just build it, then serve `/public` with your HTTP server of choice.

## Tests

... what?
